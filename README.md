# Anomaly detection for HVAC systems

The goal of this project is to explore anomaly detection methods for HVAC systems using two publicly available datasets.

# Data

The datasets used in this work are publicly available and can be retrieved from Kaggle:

- [HVAC Systems Anomaly Detection using ML](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/hvac-systems-anomaly-detection-using-ml)
- [Chiller Energy Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chillerenergy/chiller-energy-data)

# Non-residential building dataset

For the non-residential building dataset, the notebooks should be visualised in the following order:

1. [Data cleaning](notebooks/non_residential_dataset/initial_data_analysis_and_cleaning.ipynb)
2. [Data visualisation](notebooks/non_residential_dataset/data_visualisation.ipynb)
3. [Time-Series-specific visualisation methods](notebooks/non_residential_dataset/extra_plotting.ipynb) (in progress)
4. [Stationarity and correlation analysis](notebooks/non_residential_dataset/stationarity_correlations.ipynb) (in progress)

More notebooks may be added as the project goes along.
